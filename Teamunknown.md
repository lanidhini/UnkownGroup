1. Team Experience

Each team member shared a positive team experience where they worked in a successful group.

Characteristics of Successful Teams

Equal participation from all members

Clear goals and deadlines

Strong collaboration

Team members helping each other

Accountability and responsibility

Trust and honesty

Organized task distribution

Positive and supportive environment

Respect for different opinions

These are the qualities we want to bring into our current team.

2. Health Signals (How We Know Our Team Is Operating Well)

Our team is operating well when we see the following:

All members attend scheduled meetings regularly.

Meeting notes are uploaded within 24 hours.

Every GitHub issue includes:

Clear description

Assigned team member

Deadline

No task stays “In Progress” without update for more than 5 days.

Every pull request is reviewed by at least one other team member.

Team members respond to messages within 24 hours.

Work is completed before the deadline whenever possible.

Feedback is respectful and constructive.

These measurable actions show that our team is functioning effectively.

3. Psychological Safety

We will create an environment where everyone feels safe speaking up.

Our team will ensure psychological safety by:

Encouraging everyone to share ideas during meetings.

Not judging or criticizing people for asking questions.

Treating mistakes as learning opportunities.

Critiquing ideas, not individuals.

Allowing everyone equal speaking time.

Addressing disrespectful behavior immediately.

Asking if anyone has concerns before finalizing decisions.

We want every team member to feel comfortable sharing ideas, concerns, and feedback.

4. Accountability

We believe accountability is shared among all team members.

How We Will Hold Each Other Accountable

Deadlines will be clearly written in GitHub Issues.

Members must communicate before missing a deadline.

Incomplete or incorrect work must be revised.

Repeated missed deadlines will result in a team discussion.

How Team Members Should Be Approached

If a team member lets another down:

Speak to them privately first.

Be direct but respectful.

Focus on the issue, not the person.

Offer solutions and support.

Allow them to explain before making assumptions.

Our goal is improvement and responsibility, not punishment.
